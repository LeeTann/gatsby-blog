The fourth sprint went well. I worked on fixing a few bugs with the feedback pages. I got the stars to render correctly and worked on loading issues. I styled both the feedback page this week and added pagination. I had a re-render blocker but that got resolved as a team. Next week I plan to make the app more UX friendly and help out with any designs.
