The third sprint is going pretty well. It feels like the app is starting to come together and take shape. I created a top nav bar to display the user and log them out. I also worked on making the app more mobile friendly. I was able to get twilio to work when testing, just need to implement it to the project. Some of the challenges this week was going through the backend and front end code that I didn't write and try to understand them. I had to refresh my Redux knowledge as it has been some time since I have used it.
