The second sprint for Labs is going well. After the design lecture we had and after reviewing the design video and reading some documents I decided to revamp our site to give it a cleaner look. It was nice to get feedback from FJ about our design. Imposter syndrome definetly kicked in this week when I was looking at the teams github repo and starting to look over the back-end and front-end. Going through all the branches was a bit much. I'm also looking into socket.io and twilio this week to see if we can implement these tools as part of our project.
