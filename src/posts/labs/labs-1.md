The first sprint for Labs was very interesting. It was the first time working as a team of 6. Planning was definitely the hardest part of the process. We decided to split into teams of two. Zack and I were responsible of designing the UI/UX part of the project. Did not realize how hard UI/UX is as we are all full-stack developers and not really designers. I have a deeper appreciation of UI/UX designers now.
